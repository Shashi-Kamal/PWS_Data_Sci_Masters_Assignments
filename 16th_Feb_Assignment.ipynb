    "- **SQL** stands for *Structured Query Language*.\n",
    "- It is a standard *programming language* used for *managing* and *manipulating* relational databases.\n",

    "#### NoSQL databases:\n",
    "- These databases use a non-relational approach to store and manage data.\n",
    "- Mainly used for storing large amount of semi-structured and unstructured data.\n",
    "- They are highly flexible and scalable.\n",

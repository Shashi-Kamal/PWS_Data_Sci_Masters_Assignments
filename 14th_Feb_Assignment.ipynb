    "### Ans:\n",
    "#### Multi-threading:\n",
    "- Multi-threading is the ability of a processor to execute multiple threads of execution concurrently.\n",
    "- Where each thread represents a separate sequence of instructions within a single program.\n",
    "- This can be achieved through hardware-level support in a CPU, or through the use of multiple cores in a multi-core processor.\n",
    "- The OS is responsible for scheduling and managing the execution of threads on the processor, in order to maximize overall system performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why it is used?\n",
    "- to achieve faster execution times and improved overall performance of a program.\n",
    "- to improve the responsiveness of a program.\n",
    "- to enable concurrent access to shared resources.\n",
    "- to break a program down into smaller, more modular components, where each component can be executed independently by a separate thread.\n",
